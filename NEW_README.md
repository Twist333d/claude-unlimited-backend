## Overview

ClaudeUnleashed is an advanced AI-powered chat application that leverages Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model to provide intelligent conversations and assistance. It offers a web-based interface for unlimited messaging with Claude AI, bypassing the limitations of the web interface. The project is built using a Flask backend and a React frontend, providing a robust and scalable architecture for seamless AI interactions.

## Features

- Unlimited messaging with Claude AI
- Real-time token usage tracking and cost estimation
- Multi-conversation management
- User-friendly chat interface
- Conversation history storage and retrieval
- File upload capability
- Syntax highlighting and Markdown support

## Project Structure

The ClaudeUnleashed project is organized into two main components:

### Backend
- Framework: Flask (Python)
- Key features:
  - RESTful API for communication with the frontend
  - Integration with Anthropic's Claude AI API
  - SQLite database for conversation storage
  - Token usage tracking and cost estimation

### Frontend
- Framework: React
- Key features:
  - Modern, responsive user interface
  - Real-time communication with the backend
  - Efficient rendering of chat messages
  - Support for multiple conversations

## Tech Stack

- Backend:
  - Flask (Python)
  - SQLite
  - Anthropic API (Claude-3.5-Sonnet model)
- Frontend:
  - React 18
  - axios for API communication
  - styled-components for styling
  - react-window and react-virtualized-auto-sizer for efficient list rendering

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-unleashed.git
   cd claude-unleashed
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/app` directory and add your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m app.run
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.

## Usage

1. Start a new conversation or select an existing one from the sidebar.
2. Type your message in the input box and press Enter or click the send button.
3. View Claude's response and continue the conversation.
4. Check the usage statistics in the right sidebar to monitor token usage and costs.

### Advanced Features

- **File Upload**: Click the paperclip icon to upload files for Claude to analyze.
- **Code Generation**: Ask Claude to write code in various programming languages.
- **Problem Solving**: Present complex problems and watch Claude break them down and provide solutions.
- **Creative Writing**: Request Claude to help with creative writing tasks, from brainstorming to editing.

Example queries:
- "Can you explain how a binary search algorithm works and provide an implementation in Python?"
- "I've uploaded an image of a data structure. Can you analyze it and suggest improvements?"
- "Help me brainstorm ideas for a science fiction short story set on a distant planet."

## AI Capabilities

ClaudeUnleashed harnesses the power of the Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, offering:

- **Advanced Contextual Understanding**: Claude-3.5-Sonnet excels at maintaining context over long conversations, allowing for more coherent and relevant responses.
- **Complex Reasoning**: The model can break down intricate problems, analyze multiple perspectives, and provide well-reasoned solutions.
- **Code Generation and Analysis**: Claude can write, debug, and optimize code in various programming languages, explaining its thought process along the way.
- **Language Proficiency**: With support for multiple languages, Claude can assist in translation, language learning, and multilingual communication.
- **Creative Assistance**: From storytelling to poetry, Claude can provide creative ideas, help with writer's block, and even assist in developing character arcs and plot structures.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Claude can interpret complex datasets, suggest appropriate visualization methods, and even generate code for creating charts and graphs.
- **Ethical Considerations**: The model is designed to provide responses that are mindful of ethical implications and can discuss the potential impacts of AI on society.

## Future Development Plans

### Short-term Goals

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues users might encounter and their solutions:

1. **API Key Issues**:
   - Error: "Invalid API key"
   - Solution: Double-check your Anthropic API key in the backend/.env file. Ensure it's correctly copied from your Anthropic dashboard.

2. **Connection Errors**:
   - Error: "Unable to connect to server"
   - Solution: Verify that both the backend and frontend servers are running. Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

3. **Slow Response Times**:
   - Issue: Claude takes a long time to respond
   - Solution: This can be due to high server load or complex queries. Try simplifying your request or waiting a few minutes before retrying.

4. **File Upload Failures**:
   - Error: "File upload failed"
   - Solution: Ensure the file is under the size limit (typically 10MB). Check that you have write permissions in the upload directory.

If you encounter persistent issues not covered here, please check our GitHub Issues page or open a new issue with detailed information about the problem.
